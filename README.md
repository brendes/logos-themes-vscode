# Λόγος

Themes with monochrome syntax and calm UI.
An attempt is made to balance prettiness with simplicity and usability.

## About

- I find syntax highlighting that uses few colors to be less confusing than that which uses many colors.
- I get least tired of looking at the same colors all the time when I use monochrome syntax highlighting.
- I care less about the exact meaning of each color (and often can't be bothered to memorize them) than I do about being able to scan the code and quickly see its structure.

## Variants
