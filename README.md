Themes with minimal monochrome syntax highlighting and calm UI.

## About

I find most multicolored syntax and UI themes to be garish and overwhelming to look at for extended periods of time.
These themes use a few shades of a primary "base" color to highlight comments and strings.
Overall, an attempt is made to balance simplicity with usability.

## Theme variants

| variant | type  | description                   |
| ------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| white   | light | neutral theme                 |
| sun     | light | off-white theme               |
| acme    | light | yellow theme                  |
| paper   | light | warmer off-white theme        |
| dark    | dark  | neutral theme                 |
| gruv    | dark  | warm dark theme               |
| nord    | dark  | cool dark theme               |
